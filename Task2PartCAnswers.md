Part i: For each model variable in the perturbed ensemble, how does the number of 
null hypothesis rejections (i.e., non-Gaussian data) vary with latitude, model level and time?

q:
Null hypothesis rejections seem to be concentrated in high amounts all throughout the plot. 
The only section of the plot that seems to lack this characteristic is close to time indexes 0-15 roughly. 
These patterns are consistent throughout the year.

t:
Null hypothesis rejections are already much less compared to q. They have the high concentration at the 
time indexes around 50. They are less frequent throughout the rest of the plot and remain low around 
levels 0-15, albeit a bit higher than q. This pattern remains mostly consistent throughout the year.

u:
Null hypothesis rejections look very similar to that of the t plot. They have a high concentration at
the model levels around 50 and are less frequent throughout the rest of the plot. The remain low close to
time indexes 0-15 and are less frequent than both the q and t plots. The pattern remains mostly consistent
thoughout the year. You can kinda see a "wave" pattern with a trough at just below index 300 between the
model levels of 40 and 60.

v:
Null hypothesis rejections are very similar to that of the u plot. They are spread out in a similar fashion
to that of the u plot. The "wave" shape with the trough isn't really present in the v plot however. As well,
some spots, such as between time indexes 250 and 300 and at around model level 60 have a higher concentration
compared to the u plot. The pattern seen in x is mostly present in v and remains mostly consistent though.

Part ii: For each model variable, do the patterns in the perturbed ensembleâ€™s null
hypothesis rejections become visually indistinguishable from those of the reference
ensemble? If yes, when does that happen?

The patterns for each variable don't become visually indistinguishable from the reference ensemble for
most of each plot. They all do have a brief period where both the perturbed and reference plots looks visually
indistinguishable around time indexes 250-300 and model levels around 60, however, besides that, both plots
for each variable don't look much alike. The reference plots seems to have less null hypothesis rejections
compared to the perturbed plots bar the one region where both plots looks very similar.
